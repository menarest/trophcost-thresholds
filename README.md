Identifying thresholds of management intensity and environmental conditions is crucial to optimising conservation strategies and supporting biodiversity. To assess the influence of environmental, management, and landscape factors, we employed a set of traditional and newly developed conservation goals, spanning population- to ecosystem-level responses for both plants and butterflies in two regions of Germany: the Swabian Alb (ALB) and Schorfheide-Chorin (SCH). We employed multivariate analyses combined with threshold detection to determine management thresholds for these goals. 

This study is based on data from previous projects of the Biodiversity Exploratories programme (DFG Priority Programme 1374), which can be found under IDs 23586, 12526, 26487, 18148, 31018 and 20826.

The project contain a unique Quarto document that reads all datasets, run all the analyses, and create all plots of the paper.
