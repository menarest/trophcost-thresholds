Supplementary code for analyses of Menares et al. 2025, "Environmental and management thresholds for different conservation goals in grassland plant and butterfly communities"

Identifying thresholds of management intensity and environmental conditions is crucial to optimising conservation strategies and supporting biodiversity. To assess the influence of environmental, management, and landscape factors, we employed a set of traditional and newly developed conservation goals, spanning population- to ecosystem-level responses for both plants and butterflies in two regions of Germany: the Swabian Alb (ALB) and Schorfheide-Chorin (SCH). We employed multivariate analyses combined with threshold detection to determine management thresholds for these goals. 

This study is based on data from previous data of the Biodiversity Exploratories programme (DFG Priority Programme 1374), which can be found under IDs 23586, 12526, 26487, 18148, 31018 and 20826 

The project contains a unique Quarto document that reads all datasets, runs all the analyses, and creates all the plots of the paper.
